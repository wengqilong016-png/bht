# Deployment Guide

This document describes how to configure environment variables for deploying this Vite + React app on Vercel (or locally).

## Package Manager

This project uses **npm**. Always use `npm` commands — do not use `pnpm` or `yarn`.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | `npm ci` |
| Local development | `npm run dev` |
| Production build | `npm run build` |
| Type-check only | `npm run typecheck` |

Always use `npm ci` (not `npm install`) when setting up the project locally or in CI so that
dependencies match `package-lock.json` exactly. Use `npm install` **only** when you intentionally
want to update dependencies and regenerate `package-lock.json`.

> `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `yarn.lock` are listed in `.gitignore` and must not be committed.

## Environment Variables

Only browser-safe frontend variables should be prefixed with `VITE_`. Any secret used by a Vercel Function must stay server-side and must not use the `VITE_` prefix.

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xxxx.supabase.co`) | Yes |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous/public key | Yes |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Server-side OpenAI API key used by `/api/admin-ai` and `/api/scan-meter` | Optional |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Server-side Gemini API key used by `/api/scan-meter` | Yes, if AI scan is enabled |
| `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` | Server-side Google Translate API key used by `/api/translate` | Optional |
| `STATUS_API_BASE` | Server-side base URL for an external status API | Optional |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | Server-side key sent as `X-API-KEY` to the status API | Optional |
| `VITE_DISABLE_AUTH` | Local/test-only auth bypass flag; production builds ignore `true` and stay authenticated | Optional |
| `VITE_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | Set `true` only when Vercel Web Analytics is enabled for this deployment | Optional |

> **Note on Supabase credentials:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are required for the app to connect to Supabase. If they are not set, the client is initialized with empty strings and logs a console error: `[Bahati] VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY must be set. Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in your Supabase project credentials.` There are no built-in fallback credentials — the app will not connect to Supabase until valid values are configured.

> **Security note:** The Supabase service role key (`SUPABASE_KEY`) and all AI keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) must never be placed in frontend code or any `VITE_` variable. Keep them only in server-side/backend environments.

## Vercel Setup

1. Open your project in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **Settings → Environment Variables**.
3. Add each variable from the table above with the appropriate value for each environment (Production, Preview, Development).
4. Redeploy the project after saving the variables.

> **Troubleshooting:** If the app cannot connect to Supabase, check the browser console for an error from `supabaseClient.ts` mentioning missing `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. This means the env vars are not reaching the build. There are no built-in fallback credentials; set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in the deployment platform and redeploy.

## Local Development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

`.env.local` contents:

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
VITE_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
VITE_DISABLE_AUTH=false
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_google_translate_api_key_here
STATUS_API_BASE=http://localhost:5000
INTERNAL_API_KEY=your_internal_api_key_here
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
npm ci          # install exact versions from package-lock.json
npm run dev     # local development server (http://localhost:3000)
```

> **Use `npm ci` (not `npm install`) for reproducible installs.**
> `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository.

## Supabase Validation and Production Deployment

This repository now separates **automatic remote validation** from **manual
production deployment**:

1. `.github/workflows/supabase-db-check.yml` runs automatically on pushes / PRs
   that touch `supabase/migrations/**` or `supabase/config.toml`.
2. `.github/workflows/supabase-deploy.yml` is **manual** (`workflow_dispatch`)
   and is the only workflow that pushes migrations to the production Supabase
   project.

The production deploy workflow intentionally runs plain `supabase db push` and
**does not** use `--include-all`, because this repository contains multiple
historical baseline packs. Production should only receive forward, still-pending
migrations from its current remote migration history.

### Automatic validation workflow

`Validate Supabase Changes` links to the configured remote project and runs:

1. `supabase db lint --linked --fail-on error`
2. `supabase db push --dry-run --linked --yes`

This validates the **real linked database state** before any production deploy.
It does **not** publish migrations to production.

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add these three secrets under **Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [supabase.com/account/tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) → Generate new token |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | Supabase Dashboard → **Settings → Database → Database password** |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Supabase Dashboard → **Settings → General → Reference ID** (e.g. `yctsiudhicztvppddbvk`) |

> ⚠️ `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` grants full database access. Treat it like a root password —
> rotate it immediately if you believe it has been compromised (Supabase Dashboard →
> **Settings → Database → Reset database password**).

### Manual production deploy

To apply pending migrations to production:

1. Open **GitHub Actions → Deploy Supabase Migrations**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Fill in the required `reason`
4. Confirm the run targets the intended ref / SHA

Use this only after the migration change has been reviewed and validated.

> There is currently **no** `supabase-preview.yml` workflow in this repository.
> PR-time safety comes from `Validate Supabase Changes`, not from an automatic
> preview database deploy.

### Troubleshooting CI Migration Failures

#### Invalid access token format

**Error:** `Invalid access token format. Must be like 'sbp_0102...1920'.`

**Cause:** The `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret does not have the correct format.

**Fix:**
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
2. Generate a new personal access token (it will start with `sbp_`)
3. Update the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret in **Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
4. Re-run the failed workflow

> ⚠️ Make sure you're generating a **personal access token** (starts with `sbp_`), not
> the **anon key** or **service role key** from your project settings.

#### IP address not in allow list

**Error:** `Address not in tenant allow_list: {xx, xx, xx, xx}`

**Cause:** Your Supabase project has Network Restrictions enabled that block GitHub Actions runner IPs.

**Fix (Option A - Recommended for production):**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Settings → Database → Network Restrictions**
2. Add GitHub Actions IP ranges from [api.github.com/meta](https://api.github.com/meta) (look for the `actions` key)
3. Re-run the failed workflow

**Fix (Option B - Quick fix for development):**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Settings → Database → Network Restrictions**
2. Enable **Allow all IPv4 addresses**
3. Re-run the failed workflow

> ⚠️ Option B exposes your database to the public internet. Use only for development
> projects or temporarily while setting up proper IP allowlists.

#### Connection timeout or network errors

**Error:** `failed to connect to postgres: connection timeout` or similar

**Cause:** Temporary network issue or Supabase service degradation.

**Fix:**
1. Check [status.supabase.com](https://status.supabase.com) for any active incidents
2. Wait a few minutes and re-run the failed workflow
3. If the issue persists, verify your `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` is correct

#### SQL function lint errors

**Error:** messages such as `column reference "status" is ambiguous`

**Cause:** a PL/pgSQL function body is invalid for the linked database schema.
This is a code issue in the SQL definition, not a GitHub Actions secret or
network problem.

**Fix:**
1. Identify the failing function from the lint output
2. Add a new forward migration that recreates the function with the corrected SQL
3. Re-run validation

> Do not edit old production baseline files in place to repair an already-linked
> environment. Use a new migration so existing projects can move forward safely.

#### Linked database schema drift

**Error:** messages such as `column "sync_state" does not exist` for objects that
the repository expects to exist

**Cause:** the linked remote database predates the current baseline shape, or an
older environment was created before a column / constraint was added. Historical
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` migrations do not retroactively add missing columns
to existing tables.

**Fix:**
1. Add a new forward migration with explicit `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...`
   or other targeted repair statements
2. Apply defaults / `NOT NULL` / `CHECK` constraints explicitly in that migration
3. Use the manual production deploy workflow to bring the linked database forward

> Do not re-run historical baseline packs against production to repair drift.
> Repair drift with targeted forward migrations only.


## Supabase Authentication Settings (Production)

After deploying, manually sync the following settings in **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings**:

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **JWT Expiry** | `604800` (7 days) | Prevents frequent logouts for drivers and admins on slow networks |
| **Refresh Token Reuse Interval** | `60` seconds | Tolerates brief network interruptions without invalidating sessions |

> ⚠️ `supabase/config.toml` only controls the local development environment. Production JWT expiry **must** be set manually in the Supabase Dashboard — it does not update automatically from `config.toml`.

To verify the production settings are applied, log in to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication → Settings** and confirm **JWT Expiry** shows `604800`.

### Disable Force-Password-Change (one-time)

If users are being prompted to change their password on every login, run the following in **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor**:

```sql
UPDATE public.profiles SET must_change_password = FALSE;
```

## Security

See [docs/SECURITY_OPERATIONS.md](docs/SECURITY_OPERATIONS.md) for:

- Credential rotation steps
- Removing sensitive files from Git history
- Setting environment variables in CI/CD

## Android Release APK Signing

Use this checklist when you want GitHub Actions to produce a distributable signed release APK.

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets under **Repository -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions**:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded contents of the release keystore file |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore store password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Alias of the signing key inside the keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password of the signing key |

Generate the base64 payload from your local keystore:

```bash
base64 < bahati-release.keystore | tr -d '\n'
```

### CI Trigger Paths

- **Manual:** GitHub Actions -> `Build Android APK` -> `Run workflow` -> choose `release`
- **Automatic:** push to `main`, push a `v*` tag, or publish a GitHub Release

### Success Criteria

A release APK build is valid only when all of the following are true:

1. The release workflow receives all four signing secrets.
2. `./gradlew assembleRelease` succeeds.
3. `Verify release APK signature` succeeds with `apksigner verify --print-certs`.
4. The uploaded artifact is a release APK, not a debug APK.

### Manual Verification

After downloading or building the release artifact, verify the signature locally:

```bash
APKSIGNER=$(find "$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools" -name apksigner | sort | tail -n 1)
"$APKSIGNER" verify --print-certs android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

> `google-services.json` is not required for APK signing itself. It is only required when you want Android push notifications to work.

## Deployment Checklist — Stages 1 through 11A

Use this checklist when deploying a release that includes any changes from
stages 1 through 11A.  Run each step in order.

### Pre-deploy

- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally — confirm zero TypeScript errors.
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` — confirm all tests pass and coverage does
      not regress.
- [ ] Confirm all required migrations are present in `supabase/migrations/`
      (see table below).
- [ ] Confirm `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and
      `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY` are set in the deployment platform (Vercel /
      Firebase).
- [ ] Check [status.supabase.com](https://status.supabase.com) — no active
      incidents.

### Migration verification

All schema objects are created by `supabase/schema.sql`. To verify they exist:

| Object | Verification query |
|--------|-------------------|
| `calculate_finance_v2()` | `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'calculate_finance_v2';` |
| `submit_collection_v2()` | `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'submit_collection_v2';` |
| `queue_health_reports` table | `SELECT to_regclass('public.queue_health_reports');` |
| `health_alerts` table | `SELECT to_regclass('public.health_alerts');` |
| `support_audit_log` table | `SELECT to_regclass('public.support_audit_log');` |
| `support_cases` table | `SELECT to_regclass('public.support_cases');` |

### Post-deploy verification

**Finance preview (Stage 1/2)**
- [ ] Open the Collect form, enter a score above `lastScore` for any site.
- [ ] Confirm the finance summary updates in real time (server preview path).
- [ ] Toggle offline (DevTools → Network → Offline) — summary should still
      update using the local fallback.

**Server-authoritative write path (Stage 2)**
- [ ] Submit a test collection as a driver.
- [ ] Confirm the transaction appears in Admin → History with
      `isSynced: true`.
- [ ] Verify `source = 'server'` on the transaction record in Supabase.

**Offline queue and replay (Stage 3)**
- [ ] Set DevTools → Offline, submit a collection.
- [ ] Confirm Admin → Local Queue Diagnostics shows the item as pending.
- [ ] Restore network.  Within 20 seconds the item should sync and disappear
      from the queue.
- [ ] Confirm only one effective transaction row is written for the offline submission (no duplicate replay write after reconnect).
- [ ] Confirm Local Queue Diagnostics shows no dead-letter items after the sync completes.

**Settlement submission behavior**
- [ ] Confirm daily settlement submission is only attempted while online.
- [ ] If the device was offline during settlement preparation, reconnect first, then submit once and confirm the settlement is written exactly once.

**Authentication + profile bootstrap**
- [ ] Open the login page with a provisioned admin or driver account.
- [ ] Sign in with valid credentials.
- [ ] Confirm no login error banner shows `Profile not found`, `Invalid role`, or their localized equivalents.
- [ ] Confirm the app transitions into the authenticated shell instead of staying on the login form.
- [ ] For driver accounts, confirm the driver workspace loads; for admin accounts, confirm the admin console loads.

**Realtime cross-session consistency**
- [ ] Open the same admin or driver view in two browser sessions.
- [ ] In session A, create or update a transaction / driver / settlement record that should be visible in session B.
- [ ] Confirm session B refreshes automatically without a manual reload.
- [ ] Confirm the affected list/card updates once without obvious flicker or repeated loading-state flashes.
- [ ] Confirm both sessions converge to the same final values after the realtime refresh settles.

**Fleet-wide diagnostics (Stage 6)**
- [ ] Open Admin → Fleet-Wide Diagnostics.
- [ ] Confirm the active driver list is visible and no snapshots are stale.
- [ ] Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM queue_health_reports;` — expect > 0 rows.

**Health alerts (Stage 8 / 8.1)**
- [ ] Open Admin → Health Alerts.
- [ ] Confirm the panel loads without errors.
- [ ] Run `SELECT generate_health_alerts();` in SQL Editor to verify the
      function exists and executes without error.
- [ ] Confirm pg_cron job `generate-health-alerts` is scheduled:

```sql
SELECT jobname, schedule, command, active
FROM cron.job
WHERE jobname = 'generate-health-alerts';
```

**Support case linking & audit trail (Stage 9)**
- [ ] Open Admin → Audit Trail (sidebar: 操作审计).
- [ ] Confirm the panel loads without errors (empty state is expected on a fresh deploy).
- [ ] Open Admin → Cases (sidebar: 支持工单).
- [ ] Confirm the panel loads without errors and the create form works.
- [ ] Create a case → confirm `recovery_action` event appears in the audit trail.
- [ ] Close a case → confirm `recovery_action` event appears in the audit trail.
- [ ] Open Admin → Local Queue Diagnostics — confirm case picker dropdown is visible.
- [ ] Open Admin → Fleet-Wide Diagnostics — confirm case picker dropdown is visible in export filters.
- [ ] Open Admin → Health Alerts — confirm case picker dropdown and Link buttons are visible.
- [ ] Confirm cross-navigation: Cases → History → case badge click → Cases.
- [ ] Confirm both tables exist:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.support_audit_log;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.support_cases;
```

**Case resolution workflow (Stage 10)**
- [ ] Open Admin → Cases → click **Detail** on an open case.
- [ ] Confirm case detail view loads with metadata grid and resolution form.
- [ ] Select an outcome, add resolution notes, click **Resolve Case**.
- [ ] Confirm the case status changes to `closed` and resolution metadata is saved.
- [ ] Confirm a `case_resolved` audit event appears in the linked history.
- [ ] Open a closed resolved case detail → confirm resolution notes and outcome are shown read-only.
- [ ] Run the following smoke check in Supabase SQL Editor (replace `CASE-2026-001` with the case you just resolved) and confirm all checks pass.
- [ ] Confirm the resolution columns exist:

```sql
SELECT resolution_notes, resolved_by, resolved_at, resolution_outcome
FROM public.support_cases LIMIT 1;
```

**caseId normalization (Stage 11A)**
- [ ] Confirm the `support_audit_log_case_id_not_blank` CHECK constraint exists:

```sql
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid)
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'public.support_audit_log'::regclass
  AND conname = 'support_audit_log_case_id_not_blank';
```

- [ ] Confirm no blank/whitespace-only `case_id` values exist:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS blank_case_ids
FROM public.support_audit_log
WHERE case_id IS NOT NULL
  AND length(btrim(case_id)) = 0;
```

- [ ] Verify `recordAuditEvent` still works (fire-and-forget) by creating a case or triggering an export in the UI. Confirm the audit event appears in Admin → Audit Trail.

### Stage 10 post-merge smoke SQL (repeatable)

Run the following in Supabase SQL Editor, replacing `CASE-2026-001` with the case you just resolved via UI:

```sql
-- 1) Validate the case exists and is closed.
SELECT id, status, resolution_outcome, resolution_notes, resolved_by, resolved_at
FROM public.support_cases WHERE id = 'CASE-2026-001';

-- 2) Validate one case_resolved audit event exists.
SELECT id, case_id, event_type, actor_id, created_at
FROM public.support_audit_log WHERE case_id = 'CASE-2026-001' AND event_type = 'case_resolved';

-- 3) Confirm event_type CHECK includes 'case_resolved'.
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid)
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'public.support_audit_log'::regclass AND conname = 'support_audit_log_event_type_check';
```

Expect:
   - `support_cases` row shows `status='closed'` and non-null resolution metadata.
   - one `case_resolved` row exists in `support_audit_log` for the same case.
   - `event_type` CHECK includes `case_resolved`.

Quick one-liner alternative:

```sql
SELECT id, status, resolution_outcome, resolved_by, resolved_at
FROM public.support_cases
WHERE id = '<case_id>';

SELECT event_type, actor_id, created_at
FROM public.support_audit_log
WHERE case_id = '<case_id>' AND event_type = 'case_resolved'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Rollback

If any post-deploy check fails:

1. Revert the deployment to the previous build in the hosting platform to
   stop new traffic hitting the bad release.  **This only affects the app
   code and does _not_ roll back any Supabase migrations or data.**
2. Run `supabase db push --dry-run` locally to confirm whether there are
   any **pending** migrations.  This command shows what _would be applied_
   if you ran `supabase db push`; it does **not** perform or describe any
   rollback.
3. If a database migration caused the issue, identify the specific change
   (using Supabase migration history, the SQL Editor, and `setup_db.sql`)
   and create a new **forward-only** migration that repairs the problem
   (for example, restore a dropped column, relax a constraint, or backfill
   bad data).  Do not delete or roll back already-applied migrations in
   production; other features may depend on them.
4. Apply the corrective migration using the normal Supabase workflow
   (`supabase db push` for staging, then promote to production via the
   standard deploy process).
5. Open an incident in the team channel with the failing check, details of
   the corrective migration applied, and the relevant Supabase log output.

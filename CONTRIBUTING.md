# Contributing

## Local setup

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Use **npm** only. This repository is pinned to Node.js 22 / npm 10 in CI.

## Required validation before opening a PR

Run the same commands CI runs for merge gates:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:ci
npm run test:coverage:ci
npm run security:audit
npm run build
```

If your change touches end-to-end flows, also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Code style expectations

- Prefer **small, surgical TypeScript changes** over broad refactors.
- Follow the repository ESLint rules for import ordering and hook safety.
- Keep admin-facing text in Chinese (`zh`) and driver-facing text in Swahili (`sw`).
- Extend shared types in `types/` or `types.ts` instead of redefining inline shapes.
- Reuse existing helpers such as `safeRandomUUID()`, `resizeImage()`, and `normalizeCaseId()` instead of duplicating logic.

## Testing expectations

- Add unit tests for new business logic, hooks, or persistence behavior.
- Prefer focused tests around services, hooks, utilities, and edge-function behavior.
- Keep coverage changes honest: the enforced coverage gate applies to the repository's **core unit-testable surface** (services, reusable hooks, utilities, repositories, shared types, and a small set of root modules).
- Heavy integration-oriented modules such as live Supabase data/mutation hooks, AI-heavy hooks, the offline sync loop, and runtime GPS capture are intentionally excluded from the unit coverage threshold until they receive dedicated integration-focused coverage.
- Future PRs should keep expanding that covered surface rather than letting the exclusion list grow.

## CI and merge protection

The repository includes CI and Dependabot config in version control, and uses GitHub Code Scanning for CodeQL. To fully enforce “all green before merge,” enable GitHub branch protection on `main`:

1. Open **Repository Settings → Branches**.
2. Add or edit the protection rule for `main`.
3. Enable **Require a pull request before merging**.
4. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
5. Select the CI and CodeQL checks after they have run at least once.
6. Optionally enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging**.

## Maintenance automation

- Dependabot is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml` for **npm** and **GitHub Actions** updates.
- GitHub Code Scanning covers CodeQL analysis.
- SonarCloud remains optional until the repository has a real SonarCloud organization, project key, and `SONAR_TOKEN` secret. Avoid adding a placeholder Sonar workflow that would fail on every push.

## PR checklist

- Explain the user-visible or operational impact.
- Mention any schema, config, or environment-variable changes.
- Include screenshots for UI changes when helpful.
- Call out follow-up debt if you intentionally leave warnings or staged thresholds behind.
